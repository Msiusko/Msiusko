**MSiusko/intro** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- âœ¨ Privacy is a human right & fight: facilitating [Web3Privacy now](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy), writing about Web3 privacy [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073) & preaching for PEDApps (Privacy enhanced decentralised apps).  
- ðŸ’» **Work**: As a Web3 fixer > helping web3-companies mature from the chaotic state (marketing, BD and operations toolkit). 
- ðŸŒ± **Heal**: Iâ€™m Curing surveillance capitalism (after 10 years of attention economy delivery serving from Coca-Cola to Mastercard). Watch my #Free Alex Web3 activism speech from [ETH Brno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvVKltmQgo)
- ðŸ“« **Touch**: [Telegram](https://t.me/svyaznoy911) or [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/nicksvyaznoy)!
- âš¡ **Create**: Karagarga & Soulseek p2p-contributor; art cinema addict from Teshigahara to Amos Vogel (I can watch Lav Diaz 8-hour long movie with ease); [The Wire magazine](https://www.thewire.co.uk/home/) subscriber; used to be a [DJ](https://soundcloud.com/svyaznoy/light)), run a label, host radio-shows, work as a TimeOut music editor & so on. One day I need to update my artistic website [K1983](http://k1983.art)

**I believe that there's no decentralisation without an inclusion & diversity.**

_Russia is a terrorist state._
**Stand with Ukraine** ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
